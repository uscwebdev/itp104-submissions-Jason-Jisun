            <h2>History of Electric Guitar</h2>
            <p>The electric guitar, an iconic instrument in modern music, traces its origins back to the early 20th century. The quest to amplify the guitar began in the 1920s, when musicians sought a way to be heard over the louder brass and woodwind instruments in big bands. Early attempts involved attaching a resonator to the guitar to increase its volume. However, these efforts fell short of providing the necessary amplification. The breakthrough came in the 1930s when George Beauchamp, an employee of the National String Instrument Corporation, collaborated with Adolph Rickenbacker to develop the first commercially successful electric guitar. This prototype, known as the "Frying Pan" due to its circular body and long neck, used a magnetic pickup to convert string vibrations into electrical signals, which could then be amplified through a speaker.</p>

            <p>The electric guitar gained widespread popularity in the 1950s with the introduction of two landmark models: the Fender Telecaster and the Gibson Les Paul. Leo Fender's Telecaster, launched in 1950, was the first mass-produced solid-body electric guitar, known for its bright, cutting tone and simple, rugged design. Following this, Gibson introduced the Les Paul in 1952, named after the renowned guitarist and inventor Les Paul, who had been experimenting with his own solid-body designs. The Les Paul featured a thicker, more sustain-friendly body and humbucker pickups, which provided a warmer, fatter sound compared to single-coil pickups. These innovations set the stage for the electric guitar's dominance in genres like rock, blues, and jazz, and established it as a symbol of musical innovation and cultural revolution.</p>
