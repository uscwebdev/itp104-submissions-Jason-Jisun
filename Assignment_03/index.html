                <img src="img/Guitar Evolution.webp" alt="History of Electric Guitar" class="GuitarHistoryimg">
                <p>The electric guitar, an iconic instrument in modern music, traces its origins back to the early 20th century. The quest to amplify the guitar began in the 1920s, when musicians sought a way to be heard over the louder brass and woodwind instruments in big bands. Early attempts involved attaching a resonator to the guitar to increase its volume. However, these efforts fell short of providing the necessary amplification. The breakthrough came in the 1930s when George Beauchamp, an employee of the National String Instrument Corporation, collaborated with Adolph Rickenbacker to develop the first commercially successful electric guitar. This prototype, known as the "Frying Pan" due to its circular body and long neck, used a magnetic pickup to convert string vibrations into electrical signals, which could then be amplified through a speaker.</p>
